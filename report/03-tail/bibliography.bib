  abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Android operating system in a variety type of devices ranging from smart phones to smart TVs, makes it an interesting target for developers of malicious applications. One of the main flaws exploited by these developers is the permissions granting mechanism, which does not allow users to easily understand the privacy implications of the granted permissions. In this paper, we propose an approach to enforce fine-grained usage control privacy policies that enable users to control the access of applications to sensitive resources through application instrumentation. The purpose of this work is to enhance user control on privacy, confidentiality and security of their mobile devices, with regards to application intrusive behaviours. Our approach relies on instrumentation techniques and includes a refinement step where high-level resource-centric abstract policies defined by users are automatically refined to enforceable concrete policies. The abstract policies consider the resources being used and not the specific multiple concrete API methods that may allow an app to access the specific sensitive resources. For example, access to the user location may be done using multiple API methods that should be instrumented and controlled according to the user selected privacy policies. We show how our approach can be applied in Android applications and discuss performance implications under different scenarios.}

  abstract  = {End-user privacy in smart meter measurements is a well-known challenge in the smart grid. The solutions offered thus far have been tied to specific technologies such as batteries or assumptions on data usage. Existing solutions have also not quantified the loss of benefit (utility) that results from any such privacy-preserving approach. Using tools from information theory, a new framework is presented that abstracts both the privacy and the utility requirements of smart meter data. This leads to a novel privacy-utility tradeoff problem with minimal assumptions that is tractable. Specifically for a stationary Gaussian Markov model of the electricity load, it is shown that the optimal utility-and-privacy preserving solution requires filtering out frequency components that are low in power, and this approach appears to encompass most of the proposed privacy approaches.},

This paper makes three primary contributions. First, we compare existing privacy frameworks, identifying key differences and shortcomings. Second, we identify a privacy framework for mobile healthcare and home-care systems. Third, we extract a set of privacy properties intended for use by those who design systems and applications for mobile healthcare and home-care systems, linking them back to the privacy principles. Finally, we list several important research questions that the community should address. We hope that the privacy framework in this paper can help to guide the researchers and developers in this community, and that the privacy properties provide a concrete foundation for privacy-sensitive systems and applications for mobile healthcare and home-care systems.},

We examined the password retrieval mechanisms for a number of personal banking websites, and found that many of them rely in part on security questions with serious usability and security weaknesses. We discuss patterns in the security questions we observed. We argue that today's personal security questions owe their strength to the hardness of an information-retrieval problem. However, as personal information becomes ubiquitously available online, the hardness of this problem, and security provided by such questions, will likely diminish over time. We supplement our survey of bank security questions with a small user study that supplies some context for how such questions are used in practice.},

The first step is to identify the underlying density function of the original series and to estimate the parameters of this density function. The second step is to generate a series of data from the estimated density function. And the final step is to map and replace the generated series for the original one. Because it is replaced by the distorted data set, probability distortion guards the privacy of an individual belonging to the original data set. At the same time, the probability distorted series provides asymptotically the same statistical properties as those of the original series, since both are under the same distribution. Unlike conventional point distortion, probability distortion is difficult to compromise by repeated queries, and provides a maximum exposure for statistical analysis.},

In this survey, we categorize and evaluate state-of-the-art electronic health system research based on their architecture, as well as services including access control, emergency access, sharing, searching, and anonymity methods by considering their cryptographic approaches. Our survey differs from previous EHS related surveys in being method-based such that the proposed services are classified based on their methods and compared with other solutions. We provide performance comparisons and state commonly used methods for each category. We also identify relevant open problems and provide future research directions.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning based on artificial neural networks is a very popular approach to modeling, classifying, and recognizing complex data such as images, speech, and text. The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that collect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents obvious privacy issues. Users' personal, highly sensitive data such as photos and voice recordings is kept indefinitely by the companies that collect it. Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extra-judicial surveillance. Many data owners–for example, medical institutions that may want to apply deep learning methods to clinical records–are prevented by privacy and confidentiality concerns from sharing the data and thus benefitting from large-scale deep learning.In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a practical system that enables multiple parties to jointly learn an accurate neural-network model for a given objective without sharing their input datasets. We exploit the fact that the optimization algorithms used in modern deep learning, namely, those based on stochastic gradient descent, can be parallelized and executed asynchronously. Our system lets participants train independently on their own datasets and selectively share small subsets of their models' key parameters during training. This offers an attractive point in the utility/privacy tradeoff space: participants preserve the privacy of their respective data while still benefitting from other participants' models and thus boosting their learning accuracy beyond what is achievable solely on their own inputs. We demonstrate the accuracy of our privacy-preserving deep learning on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Background:}} Medicine is becoming an increasingly data-centred discipline and, beyond classical statistical approaches, artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, machine learning (ML) are attracting much interest for the analysis of medical data. It has been argued that AI is experiencing a fast process of commodification. This characterization correctly reflects the current process of \textit{industrialization} of AI and its reach into society. Therefore, societal issues related to the use of AI and ML should not be ignored any longer and certainly not in the medical domain. These societal issues may take many forms, but they all entail the design of models from a human-centred perspective, incorporating human-relevant requirements and constraints. In this brief paper, we discuss a number of specific issues affecting the use of AI and ML in medicine, such as fairness, privacy and anonymity, explainability and interpretability, but also some broader societal issues, such as ethics and legislation. We reckon that all of these are relevant aspects to consider in order to achieve the objective of fostering acceptance of AI- and ML-based technologies, as well as to comply with an evolving legislation concerning the impact of digital technologies on ethically and privacy sensitive matters. Our specific goal here is to reflect on how all these topics affect medical applications of AI and ML. This paper includes some of the contents of the “2nd Meeting of Science and Dialysis: Artificial Intelligence,” organized in the Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain. \textbf{\textit{Summary and Key Messages:}} AI and ML are attracting much interest from the medical community as key approaches to knowledge extraction from data. These approaches are increasingly colonizing ambits of social impact, such as medicine and healthcare. Issues of social relevance with an impact on medicine and healthcare include (although they are not limited to) fairness, explainability, privacy, ethics and legislation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with rapid technological advancement in both computing hardware and algorithm, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant advantage over human being in a wide range of fields, such as image recognition, education, autonomous vehicles, finance, and medical diagnosis. However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security. More specifically, we first take the lifecycle of an AI-based system as a guide to introduce the security threats that emerge at each stage, which is followed by a detailed summary for corresponding countermeasures. Finally, some of the future challenges and opportunities for the security issues in AI will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {The newly emerged machine learning (e.g., deep learning) methods have become a strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning are still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This article surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning-aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.},

These characteristics usually correlate with additional difficulties in storing, analyzing and applying further procedures or extracting results. Big data analytics is the term used to describe the process of researching massive amounts of complex data in order to reveal hidden patterns or identify secret correlations. However, there is an obvious contradiction between the security and privacy of big data and the widespread use of big data. This paper focuses on privacy and security concerns in big data, differentiates between privacy and security and privacy requirements in big data. This paper covers uses of privacy by taking existing methods such as HybrEx, k-anonymity, T-closeness and L-diversity and its implementation in business. There have been a number of privacy-preserving mechanisms developed for privacy protection at different stages (for example, data generation, data storage, and data processing) of a big data life cycle. The goal of this paper is to provide a major review of the privacy preservation mechanisms in big data and present the challenges for existing mechanisms. This paper also presents recent techniques of privacy preserving in big data like hiding a needle in a haystack, identity based anonymization, differential privacy, privacy-preserving big data publishing and fast anonymization of big data streams.

  abstract = {Background: The Cloud Computing paradigm offers eHealth systems the opportunity to enhance the features and functionality that they offer. However, moving patients' medical information to the Cloud implies several risks in terms of the security and privacy of sensitive health records. In this paper, the risks of hosting Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on the servers of third-party Cloud service providers are reviewed. To protect the confidentiality of patient information and facilitate the process, some suggestions for health care providers are made. Moreover, security issues that Cloud service providers should address in their platforms are considered. Objective: To show that, before moving patient health records to the Cloud, security and privacy concerns must be considered by both health care providers and Cloud service providers. Security requirements of a generic Cloud service provider are analyzed. Methods: To study the latest in Cloud-based computing solutions, bibliographic material was obtained mainly from Medline sources. Furthermore, direct contact was made with several Cloud service providers. Results: Some of the security issues that should be considered by both Cloud service providers and their health care customers are role-based access, network security mechanisms, data encryption, digital signatures, and access monitoring. Furthermore, to guarantee the safety of the information and comply with privacy policies, the Cloud service provider must be compliant with various certifications and third-party requirements, such as SAS70 Type II, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and the US Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). Conclusions: Storing sensitive information such as EHRs in the Cloud means that precautions must be taken to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the data. A relationship built on trust with the Cloud service provider is essential to ensure a transparent process. Cloud service providers must make certain that all security mechanisms are in place to avoid unauthorized access and data breaches. Patients must be kept informed about how their data are being managed.},

  abstract  = {Interest in critical scholarship that engages with the complexity of user experience (UX) practice is rapidly expanding, yet the vocabulary for describing and assessing criticality in practice is currently lacking. In this paper, we outline and explore the limits of a specific ethical phenomenon known as "dark patterns," where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. We assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identified dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. This analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conflated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that UX designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. We conclude with implications for the education and practice of UX designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.},

We present automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites. Using these techniques, we study shopping websites, which often use dark patterns to influence users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Analyzing 53K product pages from 11K shopping websites, we discover 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. We examine these dark patterns for deceptive practices, and find 183 websites that engage in such practices. We also uncover 22 third-party entities that offer dark patterns as a turnkey solution. Finally, we develop a taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that describes the underlying influence of the dark patterns and their potential harm on user decision-making. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for stakeholders including researchers and regulators to study, mitigate, and minimize the use of these patterns.},

The results of the analysis show that 95\% of the analyzed apps contain one or more forms of Dark Patterns and, on average, popular applications include at least seven different types of deceiving interfaces. The online experiment shows that most users do not recognize Dark Patterns, but can perform better in recognizing malicious designs if informed on the issue.

  abstract = {Dark patterns are user interfaces whose designers knowingly confuse users, make it difficult for users to express their actual preferences, or manipulate users into taking certain actions. They typically exploit cognitive biases and prompt online consumers to purchase goods and services that they do not want or to reveal personal information they would prefer not to disclose. This article provides the first public evidence of the power of dark patterns. It discusses the results of the authors’ two large-scale experiments in which representative samples of American consumers were exposed to dark patterns. In the first study, users exposed to mild dark patterns were more than twice as likely to sign up for a dubious service as those assigned to the control group, and users in the aggressive dark pattern condition were almost four times as likely to subscribe. Moreover, whereas aggressive dark patterns generated a powerful backlash among consumers, mild dark patterns did not. Less educated subjects were significantly more susceptible to mild dark patterns than their well-educated counterparts. The second study identified the dark patterns that seem most likely to nudge consumers into making decisions that they are likely to regret or misunderstand. Hidden information, trick question, and obstruction strategies were particularly likely to manipulate consumers successfully. Other strategies employing loaded language or generating bandwagon effects worked moderately well, while still others such as “must act now” messages did not make consumers more likely to purchase a costly service. Our second study also replicated a striking result in the first experiment, which is that where dark patterns were employed the cost of the service offered to consumers became immaterial. Decision architecture, not price, drove consumer purchasing decisions. The article concludes by examining legal frameworks for addressing dark patterns. Many dark patterns appear to violate federal and state laws restricting the use of unfair and deceptive practices in trade. Moreover, in those instances where consumers enter into contracts after being exposed to dark patterns, their consent could be deemed voidable under contract law principles. The article also proposes that dark pattern audits become part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s consent decree process. Dark patterns are presumably proliferating because firms’ proprietary A-B testing has revealed them to be profit maximizing. We show how similar A-B testing can be used to identify those dark patterns that are so manipulative that they ought to be deemed unlawful.},

These promises are not backed up by privacy technology that enforces the promises throughout the enterprise. Privacy tools cover fractions of the problem while leaving the main challenge unanswered.This article describes a new approach towards enterprise-wide enforcement of the privacy promises. Its core is a new framework for managing collected personal data in a sensitive, trustworthy way. The framework enables enterprises to publish clear privacy promises, to collect and manage user preferences and consent, and to enforce the privacy promises throughout the enterprise.One of the foundations of this framework is the "sticky policy paradigm" that defines a customer centric model for managing policies, preferences, and consent.},

  abstract = {Purpose In order to enhance privacy protection during electronic transactions, the purpose of this paper is to propose, develop, and evaluate a personal data management framework called Polis that abides by the following principle: every individual has absolute control over his/her personal data that reside only at his/her own side. Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies representative electronic transactions that involve personal data and proposes Polis‐based protocols for them. The approach is evaluated on a Polis prototype both as a stand‐alone application and as part of a commercial database management system. Findings The results of this paper indicate that electronic transactions can remain both feasible and straightforward, while personal data remain only at the owner's side. Research limitations/implications This paper describes a Polis‐approach implementing prototype, which is easy to deploy and friendly to current information management technologies. However, the usability of the prototype has to be enhanced with supporting tools for editing personal data and policies and a more intuitive user interface. Finally, the Polis‐platform enables a new class of user‐centered distributed applications, which it intends to investigate. Practical implications Even though the conditions for a personal data management approach like Polis are mature, and Polis can be progressively adopted, it still entails a major change in current business practices. Originality/value This paper proposes a new paradigm for the management of personal data, which admits individuals to have their personal data stored only at their own side. The new approach can be of mutual benefit to both individuals and companies.},

  abstract  = {Social Networking is one of the major technological phenomena of the Web 2.0, with hundreds of millions of people participating. Social networks enable a form of self expression for users, and help them to socialize and share content with other users. In spite of the fact that content sharing represents one of the prominent features of existing Social Network sites, Social Networks yet do not support any mechanism for collaborative management of privacy settings for shared content. In this paper, we model the problem of collaborative enforcement of privacy policies on shared data by using game theory. In particular, we propose a solution that offers automated ways to share images based on an extended notion of content ownership. Building upon the Clarke-Tax mechanism, we describe a simple mechanism that promotes truthfulness, and that rewards users who promote co-ownership. We integrate our design with inference techniques that free the users from the burden of manually selecting privacy preferences for each picture. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a protection mechanism for Social Networking has been proposed. In the paper, we also show a proof-of-concept application, which we implemented in the context of Facebook, one of today's most popular social networks. We show that supporting these type of solutions is not also feasible, but can be implemented through a minimal increase in overhead to end-users.},

Android and iOS are the most popular smartphone platforms, while the ease of use along with the computational power to handle a wide array of applications attracts millions of users worldwide, also raises the security concerns on these platforms. This paper presents a comparative analysis between Android and iOS on a wide range of security aspects. It analyzes data for the period 2015-2019 and gives a detailed snapshot of not only the quantum of vulnerabilities, but also their impact. In addition, the paper leverages the well-established security triad i.e. CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to compare both the operating systems. The comprehensive and pragmatic approach taken in the paper makes it easier to infer that Android is more susceptible to security breaches and malware attacks as compared to iOS. Hence, researchers should divert their efforts and focus on finding solutions to problems pertaining to Android. The paper concludes by laying down future research directions and scope of work, which can be leveraged not only by application developers, but also by researchers. This will help make Android safer for users and will further increase its demand as a mobile operating system.},

  abstract = {The explosive global adoption of mobile applications (i.e., apps) has been fraught with security and privacy issues. App users typically have a poor understanding of information security; worse, they routinely ignore security notifications designed to increase security on apps. By considering both mobile app interface usability and mobile security notification (MSN) design, we investigate how security perceptions of apps are formed and how these perceptions influence users’ intentions to continue using apps. Accordingly, we designed and conducted a set of controlled survey experiments with 317 participants in different MSN interface scenarios by manipulating the types of MSN interfaces (i.e., high vs. low disruption), the context (hedonic vs. utilitarian scenarios), and the degree of MSN intrusiveness (high vs. low intrusiveness). We found that both app interface usability and the design of MSNs significantly impacted users’ perceived security, which, in turn, has a positive influence on users’ intention to continue using the app. In addition, we identified an important conundrum: disruptive MSNs—a common approach to delivering MSNs—irritate users and negatively influence their perceptions of app security. Thus, our results directly challenge current practice. If these results hold, current practice should shift away from MSNs that interrupt task performance.},

  abstract  = {Email as we use it today makes no guarantees about message integrity, authenticity, or confidentiality. Users must explicitly encrypt and sign message contents using tools like PGP if they wish to protect themselves against message tampering, forgery, or eavesdropping. However, few do, leaving the vast majority of users open to such attacks. Fortunately, transport-layer security mechanisms (available as extensions to SMTP, IMAP, POP3) provide some degree of protection against network-based eavesdropping attacks. At the same time, DKIM and SPF protect against network-based message forgery and tampering. In this work we evaluate the security provided by these protocols, both in theory and in practice. Using a combination of measurement techniques, we determine whether major providers supports TLS at each point in their email message path, and whether they support SPF and DKIM on incoming and outgoing mail. We found that while more than half of the top 20,000 receiving MTAs supported TLS, and support for TLS is increasing, servers do not check certificates, opening the Internet email system up to man-in-the-middle eavesdropping attacks. At the same time, while use of SPF is common, enforcement is limited. Moreover, few of the senders we examined used DKIM, and fewer still rejected invalid DKIM signatures. Our findings show that the global email system provides some protection against passive eavesdropping, limited protection against unprivileged peer message forgery, and no protection against active network-based attacks. We observe that protection even against the latter is possible using existing protocols with proper enforcement.},

  abstract = {Email is far more convenient than traditional mail in the delivery of messages. However, it is susceptible to information leakage in business. This problem can be alleviated by classifying emails into different security levels using text mining and machine learning technology. In this research, we developed a scheme in which a neural network is used to extract information from emails to enable its transformation into a multidimensional vector. Email text data is processed using bi-gram to train the document vector, which then undergoes under-sampling to deal with the problem of data imbalance. Finally, the security label of emails is classified using an artificial neural network. The proposed system was evaluated in an actual corporate setting. The results show that the proposed feature extraction approach is more effective than existing methods for the representations of email data in true positive rates and F1-scores.},

  abstract = {The author starts by questioning the main privacy challenges raised by our present and future information society viewed as a “global village”. Apart from a comparison with the traditional village of our parents, he identifies the two complementary and not dissociable facets of our privacy: the right to seclusion and the right to participate fully in our society. According to the first German Constitutional Court recognizing the right to informational self-determination as a new constitutional right, he underlines the need to analyse the data protection as a tool for ensuring both the citizens' dignity and our democracy. The second part describes the three major changes of our technological environment: firstly, the tremendous and continuous growth of capacity of our information and communication systems; secondly, the Internet revolution with Web 2.0, the multiplication of digital identities and the convergence of all infrastructures and, finally, the ubiquitous computing. That evolution generates new privacy threats. In order to face correctly these new privacy risks, the author suggests the adaptation of our privacy legislation. Most notably, he proposes the adoption of certain principles available in environmental regulation, viz. the strong liability both of terminal equipment producers and of the infrastructure operators. The final chapter addresses three caveats to the data protection lawyers. Please, stop acting only like a lawyer. Open your mind. The information society needs a ‘Technology Assessment’ approach and better attention to the solution the technology itself might offer. Finally, the author underlines the absolute need to come back to the two keywords of the data protection legislation: transparency and proportionality and to take fully into consideration the way by which the technology might enhance the efficiency of those principles.},

Because information security policies are a necessary foundation of organizational security programs, there exists a need for scholarly contributions in this important area. Using a methodology involving qualitative techniques, we develop an information security policy process model based on responses from a sample of certified information security professionals. As the primary contribution of this research study, the proposed model illustrates a general yet comprehensive policy process in a distinctive form not found in existing professional standards or academic publications. This study's model goes beyond the models illustrated in the literature by depicting a larger organizational context that includes key external and internal influences that can materially impact organizational processes. The model that evolved from the data in this research reflects the recommended practices of our sample of certified professionals, thus providing a practical representation of an information security policy process for modern organizations. Before offering our concluding comments, we compare the results of the study with the literature in both theory and practice and also discuss limitations of the study. To the benefit of the practitioner and research communities alike, the model in this study offers a step forward, as well as an opportunity for making further advancements in the increasingly critical area of information security policy.},

  abstract = {Today, the Internet can be considered to be a basic commodity, similar to electricity, without which many businesses simply cannot operate. However, information security for both private and business aspects is important. Experts believe that technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information. Users' behaviour should be considered as an important factor in this domain. The Internet is a huge network with great potential for information security breaches. Hackers use different methods to change confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of information in line with their benefits, while users intentionally or through negligence are a great threat for information security. Sharing their account information, downloading any software from the Internet, writing passwords on sticky paper, and using social security numbers as a username or password are examples of their mistakes. Users' negligence, ignorance, lack of awareness, mischievous, apathy and resistance are usually the reasons for security breaches. Users' poor information security behaviour is the main problem in this domain and the presented model endeavours to reduce the risk of users' behaviour in this realm. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that Information Security Awareness, Information Security Organization Policy, Information Security Experience and Involvement, Attitude towards information security, Subjective Norms, Threat Appraisal, and Information Security Self-efficacy have a positive effect on users' behaviour. However, Perceived Behavioural Control does not affect their behaviour significantly. The Protection Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behaviour were applied as the backbone of the research model.},

  abstract = {Information technology has dramatically increased online business opportunities; however these opportunities have also created serious risks in relation to information security. Previously, information security issues were studied in a technological context, but growing security needs have extended researchers' attention to explore the management role in information security management. Various studies have explored different management roles and activities, but none has given a comprehensive picture of these roles and activities to manage information security effectively. So it is necessary to accumulate knowledge about various managerial roles and activities from literature to enable managers to adopt these for a more holistic approach to information security management. In this paper, using a systematic literature review approach, we synthesised literature related to management's roles in information security to explore specific managerial activities to enhance information security management. We found that numerous activities of management, particularly development and execution of information security policy, awareness, compliance training, development of effective enterprise information architecture, IT infrastructure management, business and IT alignment and human resources management, had a significant impact on the quality of management of information security. Thus, this research makes a novel contribution by arguing that a more holistic approach to information security is needed and we suggest the ways in which managers can play an effective role in information security. This research also opens up many new avenues for further research in this area.},

              To report the results of a systematic literature review concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR) systems.
              Data sources
              Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM Digital Library, Wiley InterScience, IEEE Digital Library, Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
              Study selection
              Only those articles dealing with the security and privacy of EHR systems.
              Data extraction
              The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and checked by a fourth.
              Results
              A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who should define the EHR systems’ roles. Eleven studies discuss who should provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
              Conclusions
              Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations and to deploy secure EHR systems.},

  abstract = {Social engineering has emerged as a serious threat in virtual communities and is an effective means to attack information systems. The services used by today's knowledge workers prepare the ground for sophisticated social engineering attacks. The growing trend towards BYOD (bring your own device) policies and the use of online communication and collaboration tools in private and business environments aggravate the problem. In globally acting companies, teams are no longer geographically co-located, but staffed just-in-time. The decrease in personal interaction combined with a plethora of tools used for communication (e-mail, IM, Skype, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Lync, etc.) create new attack vectors for social engineering attacks. Recent attacks on companies such as the New York Times and RSA have shown that targeted spear-phishing attacks are an effective, evolutionary step of social engineering attacks. Combined with zero-day-exploits, they become a dangerous weapon that is often used by advanced persistent threats. This paper provides a taxonomy of well-known social engineering attacks as well as a comprehensive overview of advanced social engineering attacks on the knowledge worker.},

  abstract = {IS security threats have increased significantly in recent years. We identified the gaps between manager perceptions of IS security threats and the security countermeasures adopted by firms by collecting empirical data from 109 Taiwanese enterprises. Industry type and organizational use of IT were seen as the two factors that affected the motivation of firms to adopt security countermeasures, but their implementation did not necessarily affect the threat perceptions of the managers. Analyses of responses suggested that the scope of the countermeasures adopted were not commensurate with the severity of the perceived threats. Among the threats, networks were rated as contributing the most severe threat and yet had the lowest level of protection, this was followed by threats due to personnel and administrative issues. We therefore addressed threat mitigation strategies, specifically in terms of the differences between industries.},

  abstract  = {Modern web browsers have accrued an incredibly broad set of features since being invented for hypermedia dissemination in 1990. Many of these features benefit users by enabling new types of web applications. However, some features also bring risk to users' privacy and security, whether through implementation error, unexpected composition, or unintended use. Currently there is no general methodology for weighing these costs and benefits. Restricting access to only the features which are necessary for delivering desired functionality on a given website would allow users to enforce the principle of lease privilege on use of the myriad APIs present in the modern web browser.However, security benefits gained by increasing restrictions must be balanced against the risk of breaking existing websites. This work addresses this problem with a methodology for weighing the costs and benefits of giving websites default access to each browser feature. We model the benefit as the number of websites that require the feature for some user-visible benefit, and the cost as the number of CVEs, lines of code, and academic attacks related to the functionality. We then apply this methodology to 74 Web API standards implemented in modern browsers. We find that allowing websites default access to large parts of the Web API poses significant security and privacy risks, with little corresponding benefit.We also introduce a configurable browser extension that allows users to selectively restrict access to low-benefit, high-risk features on a per site basis. We evaluated our extension with two hardened browser configurations, and found that blocking 15 of the 74 standards avoids 52.0\% of code paths related to previous CVEs, and 50.0\% of implementation code identified by our metric, without affecting the functionality of 94.7\% of measured websites.},

We make 15 types of measurements on each site, including stateful (cookie-based) and stateless (fingerprinting-based) tracking, the effect of browser privacy tools, and the exchange of tracking data between different sites ("cookie syncing"). Our findings include multiple sophisticated fingerprinting techniques never before measured in the wild. This measurement is made possible by our open-source web privacy measurement tool, OpenWPM, which uses an automated version of a full-fledged consumer browser. It supports parallelism for speed and scale, automatic recovery from failures of the underlying browser, and comprehensive browser instrumentation. We demonstrate our platform's strength in enabling researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and characterize emerging online tracking behaviors.},

There is a plethora of URL blacklists/reputation services, out of which Google's Safe Browsing and Microsoft's SmartScreen stand out as the two most commonly used ones. Frequently, such lists are the only safeguard web browsers implement against such threats. In this paper, we examine the level of protection that is offered by popular web browsers on iOS, Android and desktop (Windows) platforms, against a large set of phishing and malicious URL. The results reveal that most browsers – especially those for mobile devices – offer limited protection against such threats. As a result, we propose and evaluate a countermeasure, which can be used to significantly improve the level of protection offered to the users, regardless of the web browser or platform they are using.},

  abstract  = {Billions of users browse the Web on a daily basis, leaving their digital traces on millions of websites. Every such visit, every mouse move or button click may trigger a wide variety of hidden data exchanges across multiple tracking companies. As a result, these companies collect a vast amount of user's data, preferences and habits, that are extremely useful for online advertisers and profitable for data brokers, however very worrisome for the privacy of the users. In this emph3-hours tutorial we will cover the vide variety of Web tracking technologies, ranging from simple cookies to advanced cross-device fingerprinting. We will describe the main mechanisms behind web tracking and what users can do to protect themselves. Moreover, we will discuss solutions Web developers can use to automatically eliminate tracking from the third-party content they include in their applications. This tutorial will be of interest to a emphgeneral audience of computer scientists, and emphwe do not require any specific prerequisite knowledge for attendees. We will cover the following tracking mechanisms: beginitemize item third-party cookie tracking, and other stateful tracking techniques that enables tracking across multiple websites, item cookie respawning that is used to re-create deleted user cookies, item cookie synching that allows trackers and ad agencies to synchronise user IDs across different companies, item browser fingerprinting, including Canvas, WebRTC and AudioContext fingerprinting item cross-browser device fingerprinting, allowing trackers to recognise users across several devices. enditemize We will then demonstrate prevalence of such techniques on the Web, based on previous research. We will present the advertisement ecosystem and explain how Web technologies are used in advertisement, in particular in Real-Time-Bidding (RTB). We will explain how cookie synching is used in RTB and present recent analysis on how much a user's tracking data is worth. We will discuss the mechanisms the website owners use to automatically interact with the ad agencies, and explain its consequences on user's security and privacy. To help users protect themselves from Web tracking, we will give an overview of existing solutions. We'll start with the browser settings, and show that basic third-party cookie tracking is still possible even in the private browser mode of most common Web browsers. We then present privacy-protecting browser extensions and compare how efficient they are in protection from Web tracking. Then, we'll present possible protection mechanisms based on browser randomisation to protect from advanced fingerprinting techniques. Finally, we will present solutions for Web developers, who want to include third-party content in their websites, but would like to automatically remove any tracking of their users. In particular, we will discuss simple solutions that exist today for social plugins integration, and propose more advanced server-side based solutions that are a result of our own research.},
