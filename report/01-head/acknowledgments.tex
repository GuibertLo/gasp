This thesis would not have been possible without the support of many people. First, I am extremely grateful to my supervisor \SupervisorOne, who always supported me both in my whole education curriculum and through this thesis.

I also want to thank my other supervisor \SupervisorTwo, who accepted me as a visiting researcher and welcomed me at the University of Winchester. I am also very grateful for her supervision throughout my whole thesis despite her many obligations.

Thanks to the HES-SO//Master for allowing students to design and propose their own thesis subjects, and to ensure that the appropriate resources are provided.

And finally, I want to thank my parents, my sister, and my numerous friends who always supported me, not only during this thesis but also during my whole life.
